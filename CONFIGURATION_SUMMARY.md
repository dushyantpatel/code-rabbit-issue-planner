# Environment Configuration System Implementation

## Summary of Implementation

Implemented a comprehensive environment-specific configuration system for the Issue Planner. This system provides the following features:

### 1. Environment-Specific Configuration Files

- Created and configured separate configuration files for each environment:
    - `src/config.json` for production
    - `src/config.dev.json` for development
    - `test/test-config.json` for testing

### 2. Robust Configuration Loader

- Implemented a TypeScript-based configuration loader that:
    - Automatically selects the appropriate config file based on the NODE_ENV environment variable
    - Provides strong typing for configuration properties with the AppConfig interface
    - Falls back to safe defaults when needed
    - Validates the configuration to ensure all required properties are present and valid

### 3. Environment Variable Support

- Added support for overriding configuration settings via environment variables:
    - API port (API_PORT)
    - Logging settings (LOG_LEVEL, LOG_TO_CONSOLE, LOG_TO_FILE, LOG_FILE_PATH, LOG_ERROR_FILE_PATH)
    - LLM provider (LLM_PROVIDER)
    - LLM API keys and models (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_MODEL)
    - This allows for flexible deployment and runtime configuration without changing config files

### 4. Enhanced Logging System

- Updated the Winston-based logging system to:
    - Use environment-specific settings for log levels
    - Conditionally enable/disable file and console logging
    - Use environment-specific log file paths
    - Toggle colorized output based on environment

### 5. Modernized Test Coverage

- Replaced nyc with c8 for test coverage reporting:
    - Better compatibility with ES modules and modern TypeScript features
    - Improved reliability and performance for coverage reports
    - Configured to generate HTML, text, and lcov reports
    - Set up to properly analyze TypeScript source files

### 6. Test Support Utilities

- Created utilities for test configuration management:
    - ConfigBackup class for backing up and restoring configuration during tests
    - Utilities for modifying configuration for specific test cases
    - Integration with the test setup process

### 7. Documentation

- Comprehensive documentation of the configuration system:
    - Updated main README.md with environment configuration information
    - Created detailed CONFIG_README.md with complete documentation
    - Added examples and usage instructions

### 7. LLM Provider Flexibility

- Enhanced the system to conditionally use different LLM providers based on the environment:
    - Production: Configured for Anthropic API use with robust error handling
    - Development: Uses the mock LLM by default for cost-saving during development
    - Testing: Always uses the mock LLM for deterministic tests

## Key Benefits

1. **Development Efficiency**: Developers can work in a development environment that mimics production without incurring API costs
2. **Testing Reliability**: Tests are deterministic and don't rely on external services
3. **Security**: Sensitive values like API keys can be passed via environment variables rather than being stored in config files
4. **Flexibility**: Different environments can use completely different settings without code changes
5. **Validation**: Configuration is validated to catch issues early
6. **Documentation**: Clear documentation makes it easy for new developers to understand the system

## Future Enhancements

While the current implementation addresses the immediate needs, there are several potential enhancements for the future:

1. Support for encrypted configuration values
2. Integration with cloud secret management services
3. Support for additional LLM providers
4. Dynamic configuration reloading without application restart
5. Configuration versioning and migration utilities

The system is designed to be extensible, making it straightforward to add these enhancements in the future.
