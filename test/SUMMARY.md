# Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive testing framework has been implemented for the Code Rabbit Issue Planner API using Mocha, Chai, Sinon, and Supertest. The implementation provides both unit and integration tests with coverage reporting via NYC (Istanbul).

## Key Components

### Unit Tests

- **Controller Tests**: Test the controller functions responsible for handling business logic and API responses

    - `issueManagement.test.ts` - Tests for CRUD operations on issues
    - `issueAnalysis.test.ts` - Tests for issue analysis and planning functions

- **Service Tests**: Test the service layer functionality
    - `mockLLMClient.test.ts` - Tests for the mock LLM client implementation

### Integration Tests

- **Route Tests**: Test the complete API routes end-to-end
    - `issues.test.ts` - Tests for the issues API endpoints
    - `events.test.ts` - Tests for the events API endpoints
    - `analyzePlan.test.ts` - Tests for the analyze and plan API endpoints

### Test Utilities

- **test-helpers.ts**: Contains helper functions for creating test data
- **test-server.ts**: Creates a test Express server for integration tests
- **mocha.setup.ts**: Contains global setup for test environment

### Coverage Reporting

Coverage reporting is implemented using NYC (Istanbul), which provides detailed reporting on:

- Line coverage
- Statement coverage
- Function coverage
- Branch coverage

## Running Tests

The following npm scripts are available for running tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run tests with coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed tests for edge cases
- Add load testing for performance
- Implement CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing
- Add database mock for tests requiring persistent storage
